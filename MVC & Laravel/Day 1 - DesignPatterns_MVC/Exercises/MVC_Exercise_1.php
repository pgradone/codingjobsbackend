******* Exercise : Flower Website ********


In the Flowers table, we will record: The id, the name of the flowers, the price but also a nice picture

In this exercise, you have to 
    - Create a page where you display the list of flowers (display Name and price). With a link 'read more'.
    This link will bring you to the detail page of the flower.
    - Create a page where you display the detail of a specific flower. 
    In this page you should first print the picture then the rest of informations.


You must use MVC and OOP !!

So you have to create a FlowerController that ask the FlowerModel to return the flowers !
You probably have to create the Flower class also.
Everything will be display in the Views.
