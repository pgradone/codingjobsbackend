  GIT STEPS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE 
  ON A PROJECT :

  1 - One of you create a new project on 
  your computer

  2 - 'git init' on this project

  3 - Go to github and create a new repo

  4 - Link the remote repo with the local one
  (just follow the first steps on github)
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Yourproject
    git push -u origin master

  5 - Add your collaborators (settings tab on github)

  6 - Once it's done, the other person
  on the project have to clone the github project
  'git clone 'https://github.com/Yourproject'

  7 - This is it ! Your projects are synchronized
  You can add file, commit, push...
  Don't forget to create branches !
